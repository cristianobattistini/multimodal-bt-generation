__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: kitchen.

Instruction: Make a pizza on the cookie sheet in the kitchen: take the grated cheese, the four pieces of pepperoni, and the two mushrooms from their tupperware containers in the refrigerator; chop the Vidalia onion on the chopping board with the knife, and also chop the two whole mushrooms in half; top the pizza dough that’s already on the cookie sheet with the cheese, pepperoni, halved mushrooms, and chopped onion; bake it in the oven until it becomes a pizza, and leave the finished pizza on the cookie sheet.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj), PLACE_UNDER(obj)]
Available Objects: bowl, cabinet, carving_knife, chopping_board, cookie_sheet, countertop, electric_refrigerator, floor, grated_cheese, mushroom, oven, pepperoni, pizza, pizza_dough, tupperware, vidalia_onion

Open refrigerator, get toppings, place on pizza_dough. Grasp knife, CUT mushrooms and onion, add to pizza. Place cookie_sheet in oven, TOGGLE_ON to bake.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
