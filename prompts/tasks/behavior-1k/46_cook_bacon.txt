__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: kitchen.

Instruction: Take the tray with six slices of bacon out of the refrigerator in the kitchen, cook all six slices in the frying pan on the stove until they’re cooked, and make sure the refrigerator is closed when you’re done.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj), TOGGLE_ON(obj)]
Available Objects: bacon, electric_refrigerator, floor, frying_pan, stove, tray

Open refrigerator, place all bacon slices in frying_pan, TOGGLE_ON stove, close refrigerator when done.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
