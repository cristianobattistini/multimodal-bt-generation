__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: childs_room.

Instruction: In the child’s room, clean up the desk: put both folders and both paperback books into the bookcase; put the pencil and both pens into the pencil case and leave the case on the desk; take the stapler out of the bookcase and place it on the desk; move the laptop from the bed onto the desk and close it.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: bed, bookcase, chair, desk, floor, folder, laptop, paperback_book, pen, pencil, pencil_box, stapler

Open bookcase to place items inside. Place items inside pencil_case. Close laptop before placing on desk.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
