__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

Instruction: Put all the toys inside the toy_box. There are exactly 6 toys scattered around the room: board_game_1, board_game_2, board_game_3, jigsaw_puzzle_1, jigsaw_puzzle_2, and tennis_ball. Pick up each toy one by one and place it in the toy_box until all 6 are inside.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj)]
Available Objects: board_game_1, board_game_2, board_game_3, jigsaw_puzzle_1, jigsaw_puzzle_2, tennis_ball, toy_box

Generate a complete plan that handles all 6 toys.
