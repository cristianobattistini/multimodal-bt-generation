__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: kitchen.

Instruction: Sort the vegetables from the two wicker baskets on the kitchen floor into the mixing bowls on the kitchen countertop: put all three bok choy and all three Vidalia onions together into one mixing bowl; put both leeks and both broccoli together into a second mixing bowl; and put all three sweet corn into a third mixing bowl.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: bok_choy, broccoli, countertop, floor, leek, mixing_bowl, sweet_corn, vidalia_onion, wicker_basket

Navigate to each vegetable, grasp it, and place it inside the correct mixing_bowl based on type.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
