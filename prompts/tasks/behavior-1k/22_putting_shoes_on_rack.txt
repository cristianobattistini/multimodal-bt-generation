__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: corridor.

Instruction: Pick up the two gym shoes and the two sandals from the corridor floor and place them onto the hallstand (shoe rack) in the corridor, making sure they are on the rack and not on the floor. Arrange them so the two gym shoes are next to each other and the two sandals are next to each other.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj), PLACE_UNDER(obj)]
Available Objects: floor, gym_shoe, hallstand, sandal

Use PLACE_ON_TOP to put shoes onto the hallstand. Use PLACE_NEXT_TO to arrange shoes next to each other.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
