__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: kitchen.

Instruction: From the refrigerator in the kitchen, take out the two bell peppers, the two beets, and the zucchini. Then, on either chopping board on the countertop, use the parer to dice all of them so that only diced bell pepper, diced beet, and diced zucchini remain. Make sure the refrigerator is closed when you finish.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), CUT(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: beet, bell_pepper, chopping_board, countertop, diced_beet, diced_bell_pepper, diced_zucchini, electric_refrigerator, floor, parer, zucchini

Open refrigerator, place all vegetables on chopping_board, grasp parer, CUT each vegetable. Close refrigerator when done.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
