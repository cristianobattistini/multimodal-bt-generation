__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

Instruction:
Step 1: Go to the sack, pick it up, go to the electric_refrigerator and place it beside the fridge.
Step 2: IMMEDIATELY open the electric_refrigerator (your hands are now empty after placing the sack).
Step 3: Go to the beefsteak_tomato, pick it up, go to the electric_refrigerator and put it inside.
Step 4: Go to the carton_of_milk, pick it up, go to the electric_refrigerator and put it inside.
Step 5: Close the electric_refrigerator.
Step 6: Go to the car and close it.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(destination), PLACE_NEXT_TO(destination), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: beefsteak_tomato, car, carton_of_milk, electric_refrigerator, sack

NOTE: For PLACE_INSIDE and PLACE_NEXT_TO, obj is the DESTINATION (where to place), not what you're holding. Example: to put tomato in fridge, use PLACE_INSIDE obj="electric_refrigerator".

CRITICAL: After PLACE_NEXT_TO, you must OPEN the fridge IMMEDIATELY (before any GRASP). You cannot open the fridge while holding something.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
