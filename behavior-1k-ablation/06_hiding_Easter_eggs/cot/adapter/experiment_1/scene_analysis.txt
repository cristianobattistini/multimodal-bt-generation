scene_analysis:
  target: "easter_egg_1, easter_egg_2, easter_egg_3"
  destination: "tree_1"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the three Easter eggs from the wicker basket on the lawn and place each egg next to the tree; if a grasp fails, retry up to 3 times with a 10s timeout and, if unsuccessful, push to reposition before retrying."
  scene_context: "Easter eggs are inside the wicker basket on the lawn; tree_1 is nearby and reachable; no containers are closed."
  expected_sequence: "For each egg, reach into the basket, pick it up, move to the tree, and place it next to the tree; if grasp fails, retry up to 3 times (10s timeout) and push to reposition before retrying."
