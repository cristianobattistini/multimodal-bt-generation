scene_analysis:
  target: "easter_eggs"
  destination: "tree_1"
  expanded_instruction: "In the garden, retrieve the three Easter eggs from the wicker basket on the lawn and place each egg next to the same tree (tree_1)."
  scene_context: "The scene shows a grassy lawn with trees and shrubs; a prominent tree (tree_1) stands ahead. The wicker basket with the eggs is mentioned in the instruction but not visible in the current view."
  expected_sequence: "For each egg (easter_egg_1, easter_egg_2, easter_egg_3): navigate to the egg, grasp it from the basket, navigate to tree_1, and place it next to tree_1."
