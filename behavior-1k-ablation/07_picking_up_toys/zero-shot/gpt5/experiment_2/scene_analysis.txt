scene_analysis:
  target: "toys"
  destination: "toy_box"
  expanded_instruction: "Collect board_game_1, board_game_2, board_game_3, jigsaw_puzzle_1, jigsaw_puzzle_2, and tennis_ball, and place each inside the toy_box. Several toys and the toy_box are visible on the desk; gather each toy one by one and insert into the toy_box until all six are inside."
  scene_context: "The toy_box is on the desk. At least three toys (a tennis ball and two boxed items/puzzles) are on the desk near the chair; remaining toys may be elsewhere in the room. The robot must visit each toy, pick it up, go to the toy_box, and place it inside."
  expected_sequence: "For each toy: navigate to the toy, grasp it, navigate to the toy_box, and place it inside. Repeat for board_game_1, board_game_2, board_game_3, jigsaw_puzzle_1, jigsaw_puzzle_2, and tennis_ball."
