scene_analysis:
  target: "toys"
  destination: "toy_box"
  expanded_instruction: "Collect each of the six toys (board_game_1, board_game_2, board_game_3, jigsaw_puzzle_1, jigsaw_puzzle_2, tennis_ball) one at a time and place them into the toy_box on the desk."
  scene_context: "A toy_box (gray bin) is on the right side of the desk. At least some toys (e.g., a tennis_ball and flat game/puzzle boxes) are on the desk surface; others may be elsewhere in the room."
  expected_sequence: "For each toy: navigate to the toy, grasp it, navigate to the toy_box, and place it inside. Repeat until all six toys are in the toy_box."
