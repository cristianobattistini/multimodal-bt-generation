  target: ["board_game_1", "board_game_2", "board_game_3", "jigsaw_puzzle_1", "jigsaw_puzzle_2", "tennis_ball"]
  destination: "toy_box"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up each of the 6 toys (board_game_1, board_game_2, board_game_3, jigsaw_puzzle_1, jigsaw_puzzle_2, tennis_ball) and place them one by one into the gray toy_box on the table."
  scene_context: "Gray toy_box on the table is open and empty; board_game_1, board_game_2, and board_game_3 are on the counter near the box; jigsaw_puzzle_1 is on the floor; tennis_ball is on the table; nothing is held."
  expected_sequence: "For each toy, approach the object, pick it up, move it to the gray toy_box on the table, and release it inside until all 6 toys are placed inside the box."
