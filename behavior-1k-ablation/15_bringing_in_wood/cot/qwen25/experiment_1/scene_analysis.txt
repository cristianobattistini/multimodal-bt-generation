scene_analysis:
  target: ["plywood_1", "plywood_2", "plywood_3"]

  scene_context: "Three plywood sheets lie on the garden floor, none are held, and the corridor floor is clear."
  expected_sequence: "For each plywood sheet, move to it, pick it up (if grasp fails, retry up to 3 times), carry it to the corridor, and set it down on the floor there; repeat for all three sheets."
