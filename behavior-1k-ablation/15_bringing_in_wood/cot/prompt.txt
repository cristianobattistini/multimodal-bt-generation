__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: corridor, garden.

Instruction: Bring the three plywood sheets from the garden into the corridor. The plywood sheets are on the garden floor. Pick them up one by one and place each one on the corridor floor. All three plywood sheets must end up on the corridor floor.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj)]
Available Objects: plywood_1, plywood_2, plywood_3, corridor_floor

The robot can only carry one object at a time. For each plywood sheet: navigate to it, grasp it, navigate to the corridor_floor, then place it on top of the corridor_floor. Do this cycle for all three plywood sheets.

Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
