  target: "plywood_1"
  destination: "corridor_floor"
  expanded_instruction: "Bring the three plywood sheets from the garden into the corridor. Pick up plywood_1 from the garden floor and place it on the corridor floor, then pick up plywood_2 and place it on the corridor floor, and finally pick up plywood_3 and place it on the corridor floor."
  scene_context: "Plywood_1 is on the garden floor, plywood_2 and plywood_3 are on the corridor floor, and the corridor_floor is clear."
  expected_sequence: "Reach to plywood_1, grasp and lift it, move to the corridor_floor, place it down on the floor, then pick up plywood_2 and place it on the corridor_floor, and finally pick up plywood_3 and place it on the corridor_floor."
