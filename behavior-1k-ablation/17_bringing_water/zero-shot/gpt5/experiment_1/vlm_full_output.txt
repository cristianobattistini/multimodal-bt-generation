scene_analysis:
  target: "bottle_1 and bottle_2"
  destination: "coffee_table"
  expanded_instruction: "Go to the kitchen refrigerator, open it, retrieve both bottles (bottle_1 and bottle_2), take them to the living room, and place both on the coffee_table. Ensure the refrigerator is closed when finished."
  scene_context: "The image shows a kitchen area with a tall white electric_refrigerator that appears closed. The living room with a sofa is visible in the background, with a coffee table in front of it."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the electric_refrigerator, open it, grasp bottle_1, go to the coffee_table and place it. Return to the electric_refrigerator, grasp bottle_2, go to the coffee_table and place it. Finally, return to the electric_refrigerator and close it."
