__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

Instruction: Retrieve the two bottles from the refrigerator in the kitchen, bring them to the living room, and place both on the coffee table. Make sure the refrigerator is closed when you finish.

Objects to handle:
- bottle_1, bottle_2 (inside refrigerator) → place on top of coffee_table
- electric_refrigerator (must be opened first, closed at the end)

Workflow: Navigate to the electric_refrigerator and open it. Navigate to bottle_1, pick it up, navigate to the coffee_table, and place it on top. Navigate back to bottle_2, pick it up, navigate to the coffee_table, and place it on top. Finally, navigate to the electric_refrigerator and close it.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: bottle_1, bottle_2, coffee_table, electric_refrigerator

Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
