__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: bathroom.

Instruction: Set up four mousetraps in the bathroom. The mousetraps are visible on the cabinet shelf. Pick them up one by one and place each one next to the bathroom sink. All four mousetraps must end up beside the sink.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj)]
Available Objects: mousetrap_1, mousetrap_2, mousetrap_3, mousetrap_4, cabinet, sink

Workflow: The robot can only carry one object at a time. For each mousetrap: navigate to it, grasp it, navigate to the sink, then place it next to the sink. PLACE_NEXT_TO(sink) will put the mousetrap on the floor beside the sink. Do this cycle for all four mousetraps.

Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
