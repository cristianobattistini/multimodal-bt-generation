ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

The robot is in a scene with these rooms: kitchen.

Instruction: Put all eight plates into a single cabinet and close it when done. The plates are on the two countertops (four on each). Choose one cabinet and put all plates inside it.

Objects to handle:
- plate_1, plate_2, plate_3, plate_4 (on first countertop)
- plate_5, plate_6, plate_7, plate_8 (on second countertop)
- cabinet (destination for all plates)

Workflow: First, open the cabinet. Then for each plate, navigate to it, pick it up, navigate to the cabinet, and place it inside. The robot can only carry one plate at a time. After all eight plates are inside the cabinet, close it. The sequence is: OPEN cabinet, then repeat 8 times (NAVIGATE_TO plate_N, GRASP plate_N, NAVIGATE_TO cabinet, PLACE_INSIDE cabinet), then CLOSE cabinet.

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: plate_1, plate_2, plate_3, plate_4, plate_5, plate_6, plate_7, plate_8, cabinet

IMPORTANT: You MUST open the cabinet BEFORE placing any plates inside. The cabinet starts closed.
Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
