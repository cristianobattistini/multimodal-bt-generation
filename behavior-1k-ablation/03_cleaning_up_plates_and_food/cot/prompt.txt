__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

Instruction: First open the refrigerator, store the plates inside, close it, then put the bowls in the sink.

Sequence:
1. Go to refrigerator and open it (hands empty)
2. For each plate: pick up → bring to fridge → place inside fridge
3. Close the refrigerator
4. For each bowl: pick up → bring to SINK → place inside SINK (NOT the fridge!)

Destinations:
- plate.n.04_1, plate.n.04_2 → electric_refrigerator.n.01_1 (fridge)
- bowl.n.01_1, bowl.n.01_2 → sink.n.01_1 (sink, not fridge!)

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj)]
Available Objects: plate.n.04_1, plate.n.04_2, bowl.n.01_1, bowl.n.01_2, electric_refrigerator.n.01_1, sink.n.01_1
