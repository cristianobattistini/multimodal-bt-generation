scene_analysis:
  target: ["tennis_racket", "container", "digital_camera"]
  destination: "car"
  expanded_instruction: "Check that the car trunk is closed and open it if needed. Check the garage before proceeding; if not open, retry up to 3 times with a 10s timeout and leave it alone if it fails. Pick up the tennis_racket from the table and place it in the car's cargo area; if it is already held, leave it there. Then pick up the container and place it on the seat; if placing fails, retry up to 3 times (10s timeout, leave on seat if placement fails). Finally, pick up the digital_camera from the table and place it inside the container; if placing inside fails, push to reposition and retry up to 3 times (10s timeout, leave on top if unsuccessful)."
  scene_context: "Car is in the garage with the trunk closed; digital_camera and tennis_racket on the table; container on the floor and reachable."
  expected_sequence: "Check that the car trunk is closed and open it if needed (retry up to 3 times within a 10s timeout; if it fails, leave the trunk closed). Then pick up the tennis_racket (if held, leave it) and place it in the cargo area (retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout, if placing fails, push to reposition). Next pick up the container and place it on the seat (retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout, if placing fails, push to reposition); if placing fails, push to reposition. Finally, pick up the digital_camera (if held, leave it) and place it into the container (if placing inside fails, push to reposition and retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout, leave on container if unsuccessful); if placing inside fails, push to reposition and retry up to 3 times (10s timeout, leave on top if placement fails)."
