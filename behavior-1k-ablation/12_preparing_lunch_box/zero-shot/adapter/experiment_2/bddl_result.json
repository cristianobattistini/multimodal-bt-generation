  "reason": "BT attempts all 5 objects but with confusing bottle sequence (GRASP bottle, navigate to fridge, OPEN fridge, navigate back, GRASP again, PLACE_INSIDE). Redundant actions and unnecessary OPEN mid-sequence caused physics disruption. Also executes invalid CLOSE on packing_box and bottle_of_tea instead of only refrigerator. Despite placing all 5 objects, 3 (half_apples, cookie, bottle) were displaced by physics. Only club_sandwich retained Inside predicate."
