__RAW__
ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.
INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: plain text description of the task to perform
- Allowed Actions: the ONLY actions you can use. Do NOT invent or use actions outside this list.
- Allowed Conditions (optional): list of conditions for precondition checks, if provided.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>
CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Strict Compliance: Use ONLY actions from Allowed Actions. Never hallucinate or invent actions not in the list.
5. Multiple Instances: When manipulating multiple objects of the same type, use numbered suffixes (e.g., object_1, object_2, object_3) to distinguish each instance in the XML plan.

Instruction:
Step 1: Go to the door and open it (your hands are free at the start).
Step 2: Go to storage_container_1, pick it up, go to garage_floor and place it there.
Step 3: Go to storage_container_2, pick it up, go to storage_container_1 and place it on top of the other container

Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), OPEN(obj)]
Available Objects: storage_container_1, storage_container_2, garage_floor, door

CRITICAL: You must OPEN the door FIRST while your hands are empty. You cannot open doors while holding something.

NOTE: For PLACE_ON_TOP, the obj parameter specifies WHERE to place (the destination surface), not what you're holding. The XML attribute must always be obj="...". Example: <Action ID="PLACE_ON_TOP" obj="garage_floor" />

Generate the simplest Sequence plan without Fallback nodes.
