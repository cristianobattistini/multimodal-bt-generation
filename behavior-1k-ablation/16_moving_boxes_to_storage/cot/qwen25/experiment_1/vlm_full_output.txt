scene_analysis:
  target: "["door", "storage_container_1", "storage_container_2"]"
  destination: "garage_floor"
  expanded_instruction: "Open the door (if closed, reach to its handle and pull it open); then navigate to each storage container (reach to the handles or latches, and attempt to grasp and lift the containers), move to the garage floor, and set the containers down."
  scene_context: "Door is closed with visible handle; both storage containers reachable; garage_floor area clear; no containers held."
  expected_sequence: "Open the door (reach to the door handle and pull it open) and reach to each storage container (reach to the handles/latches) one by one, attempt to grasp and lift each container, move over the garage floor, and set the containers down."
