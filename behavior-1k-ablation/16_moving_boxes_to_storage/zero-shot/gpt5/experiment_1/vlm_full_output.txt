scene_analysis:
  target: "storage_container_1"
  destination: "garage_floor"
  expanded_instruction: "Open the closed wooden door first, then pick up storage_container_1 and place it on the garage_floor, then pick up storage_container_2 and stack it on top of storage_container_1."
  scene_context: "The scene shows a closed interior wooden door in a mostly empty garage-like room with a clear concrete floor and good lighting. The storage containers are not in view but are available objects in the workspace."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the door and open it. Navigate to storage_container_1, grasp it, navigate to the garage_floor, and place it on the floor. Then navigate to storage_container_2, grasp it, navigate to storage_container_1, and place storage_container_2 on top of storage_container_1."
