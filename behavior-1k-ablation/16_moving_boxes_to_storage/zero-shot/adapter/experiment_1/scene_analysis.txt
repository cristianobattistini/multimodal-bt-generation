  scene_context: "Front door is closed; storage_container_1 is left of the door on the floor and is not held; garage_floor is clear and reachable."
  expected_sequence: "Open the front door, pick up storage_container_1 and place it on the garage_floor, then move storage_container_2 and stack it on top of storage_container_1."
