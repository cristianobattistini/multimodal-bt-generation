ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: place dishes in the dish rack. If placing inside fails, push the inside of the dish rack to clear or reposition obstacles and retry placing.
- Allowed Actions: [PUSH(obj), GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness strategy: When placing inside the dish rack fails, attempt a PUSH to clear or reposition interiors of the dish rack, then retry placing to improve success under cluttered or obstructed conditions.
