ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: place dishes in the dish rack. If grasping the cup fails, push it to reposition and retry grasping.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), PUSH(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "cup"
  destination: "dish_rack"
  expanded_instruction: "Place dishes in the dish rack. If grasping the cup fails, push it to reposition and retry grasping."
  scene_context: "The cup is on the countertop among other dishes; it may be awkwardly oriented, partially occluded, or slightly out of optimal reach for the gripper."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the cup, attempt grasping (if grasping fails, push the cup to reposition and attempt grasping again), navigate to the dish rack, place the cup inside, and release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness: If primary grasping fails, use a distinct repositioning action (push the cup) that changes the object's pose before retrying the grasp to handle occlusion or awkward orientations.
