  scene_context: "Plate is leaning in the rack, cup is on the drying_mat to the right, dish_rack open with empty slots."
  expected_sequence: "Place the plate into a vertical slot of the dish_rack, then pick up the cup and set it in the rack; if a grasp fails for either object, retry up to 3 times and use push or flip to reposition (within a 10s timeout) before retrying."
