ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Place dishes in the dish rack. Retry placing inside up to 4 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [RELEASE(), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "dishes"
  destination: "dish_rack"
  expanded_instruction: "Place dishes in the dish rack. Retry placing inside up to 4 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "Several dirty dishes are on the counter within reach. The dish rack is located near the sink and appears to have available slots."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the dishes, grasp the dishes, navigate to the dish rack, attempt to place them inside the dish rack (retrying up to 4 times on failure), then release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness: Wrap PLACE_INSIDE with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="4").
