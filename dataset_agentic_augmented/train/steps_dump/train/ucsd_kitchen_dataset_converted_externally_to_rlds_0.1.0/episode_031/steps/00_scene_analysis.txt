scene_analysis:
  target: "canned_spam"
  destination: "sink"
  expanded_instruction: "Check that canned_spam IS_VISIBLE on the counter (retry up to 3 times or within a 10s timeout); then pick up the canned_spam from the counter and place it into the sink basin. If grasp fails, push to reposition and retry the grasp before placing."
  scene_context: "Canned_spam sits on the countertop next to the faucet; sink basin is uncovered and clear."
  expected_sequence: "Verify canned_spam IS_VISIBLE, retrying up to 3 times/within 10s; approach the can, grasp and lift it (if grasp fails, push to reposition and retry), move over the sink, and release it into the basin."
