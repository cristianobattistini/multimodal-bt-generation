ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Place the bread, butter, and milk from the table onto the serving area. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

scene_analysis:
  target: "butter"
  destination: "serving_area"
  expanded_instruction: "Place the bread, butter, and milk from the table onto the serving area. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "Bread, butter, and milk are on the table; serving area is reachable. Objects are within arm reach but grasping may fail intermittently for the butter."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to milk, grasp milk, navigate to serving area, place milk on serving area, release; then navigate to butter, attempt to grasp butter up to three times until successful, navigate to serving area, place butter on serving area, release."

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap GRASP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="3").
