scene_analysis:
  target: "["pot", "lid", "tool"]"
  destination: "plate"
  expanded_instruction: "Check that the pot is reachable (perform IS_REACHABLE check; retry up to 3 times) before removing the lid. Remove the lid from the pot, place the pot onto the plate, then use the tool to push the pot to the front edge of the table."
  scene_context: "Lid is on the pot; plate is clear on the table; tool is nearby on the left and nothing is held."
  expected_sequence: "Verify the pot is reachable (IS_REACHABLE check, retry up to 3 times), then take the lid off the pot, set the pot down on the plate, then use the tool to push the pot toward the front of the table."
