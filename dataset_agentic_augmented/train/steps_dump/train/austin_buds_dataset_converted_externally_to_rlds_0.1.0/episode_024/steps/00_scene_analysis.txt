scene_analysis:
  target: "["lid", "pot", "tool"]"
  destination: "plate"
  expanded_instruction: "Check the pot is visible, remove the lid, grasp the pot within a 10s timeout (if grasp fails, use push or flip to reposition), place the pot onto the plate, then use the tool to push the pot to the front edge of the table."
  scene_context: "Pot on table with lid on, plate nearby and empty, spatula-like tool to the left, front table edge clear."
  expected_sequence: "Confirm the pot is visible, take off the lid, grasp the pot (within a 10s timeout; if grasp fails, push or flip to reposition), put the pot down on the plate, then push the pot with the tool toward the front edge of the table."
