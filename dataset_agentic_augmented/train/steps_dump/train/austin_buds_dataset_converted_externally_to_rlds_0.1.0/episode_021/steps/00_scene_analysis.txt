  expanded_instruction: "Begin with an ApproachPot subtree: approach the pot (retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout), remove the lid, place the pot on the plate, then use the tool to push the pot to the front edge of the table (if push fails, reposition and retry)."
  scene_context: "Pot is on the cook surface with its lid on; plate is nearby on the table; tool (spatula) is reachable; table front is clear."
  expected_sequence: "As part of the ApproachPot subtree: approach the pot (retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout), take off the lid and set it aside, lift and place the pot on the plate, then use the tool to push the pot forward to the front edge of the table (if grasp or push fails, reposition and retry)."
