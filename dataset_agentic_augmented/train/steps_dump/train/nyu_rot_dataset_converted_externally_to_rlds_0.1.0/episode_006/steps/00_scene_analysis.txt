scene_analysis:
  target: "hanger"
  destination: "rod"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the black hanger from the table edge and place its hook over the metal rod so it hangs securely. If grasping fails, retry up to 2 times; if still unsuccessful, push or flip the hanger to reposition it and then try again."
  scene_context: "Hanger resting on table edge near a metal rod with blue tape; rod is free and robot gripper not holding the hanger."
  expected_sequence: "Reach to the hanger, grasp it (retry grasp up to 2 times if it fails), move the hook over the rod, and release so the hanger hangs on the rod; if grasp repeatedly fails, push or flip the hanger to reposition it and then attempt grasp again."
