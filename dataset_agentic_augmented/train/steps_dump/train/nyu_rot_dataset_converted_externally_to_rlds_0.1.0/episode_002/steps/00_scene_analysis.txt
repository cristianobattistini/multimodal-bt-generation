scene_analysis:
  target: "bag"
  destination: "hook"
  expanded_instruction: "Place the bag by its strap onto the metal hook mounted on the vertical pole so it hangs securely. Before hanging, check the hook's IS_HOLDING status and, if not ready, retry the check up to 3 times within a 10s timeout, then proceed to hang."
  scene_context: "Robot is holding the bag near a vertical pole; the metal hook above is empty and reachable."
  expected_sequence: "Verify hook IS_HOLDING is true (retry up to 3 times within 10s if needed); position the strap over the hook, lower the bag onto the hook, and release so it hangs securely."
