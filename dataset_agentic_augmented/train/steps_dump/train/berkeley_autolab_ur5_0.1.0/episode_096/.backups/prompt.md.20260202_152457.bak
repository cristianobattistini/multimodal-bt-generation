ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Take the tiger out of the red bowl and put it in the grey bowl. If placing the tiger inside the grey bowl fails, push inside the grey bowl to clear or reposition obstacles and retry placing.
- Allowed Actions: [RELEASE(), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PUSH(obj), GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness strategy: The plan uses a fallback decorator around the placing action. If placing inside the grey bowl fails due to interior clutter or misalignment, the robot will perform a push inside the grey bowl to clear or reposition obstacles, then retry placing. This alternative strategy is a different action (not a retry of the same primitive) intended to change the scene to make placement succeed.
