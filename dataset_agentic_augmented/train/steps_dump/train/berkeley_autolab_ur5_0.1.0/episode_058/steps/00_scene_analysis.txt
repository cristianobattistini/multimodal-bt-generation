scene_analysis:
  target: "blue_cup"
  destination: "brown_cup"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the blue cup from the table and place it into the brown cup on the table. Group the approach and grasp steps into an ApproachBlueCup subtree that may retry up to 3 times with a 10s timeout and, if grasp fails, push to reposition before retrying."
  scene_context: "Blue cup upright on table and not held; brown cup open on table and clear to receive object."
  expected_sequence: "Approach and grasp the blue cup (grouped into an ApproachBlueCup subtree with up to 3 retries and a 10s timeout; if grasp fails, push to reposition), lift it, move it over the brown cup, lower it into the brown cup, and release."
