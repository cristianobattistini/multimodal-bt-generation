ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Open the kcup holder, insert the kcup into the holder, and close the kcup holder. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), OPEN(obj), CLOSE(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj)]

scene_analysis:
  target: "kcup"
  destination: "kcup_holder"
  expanded_instruction: "Open the kcup holder, insert the kcup into the holder, and close the kcup holder. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "The kcup is on the countertop in front of the robot. The kcup_holder is currently closed. No other obstructions observed."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the kcup_holder and open it. Navigate to the kcup and grasp it (retrying grasping up to 3 times if needed). Return to the kcup_holder, place the kcup inside, release it, and close the kcup_holder."
OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap GRASP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="3").
