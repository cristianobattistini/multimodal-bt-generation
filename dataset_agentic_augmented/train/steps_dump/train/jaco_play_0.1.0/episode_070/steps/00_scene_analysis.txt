  expanded_instruction: "Check that the steak_meat is reachable (IS_REACHABLE) before navigating — retry the reachability check up to 3 times with a 10s timeout; if reachable, pick up the steak meat from the white plate on the table near the robot arm. If reachability fails, report and abort or reposition and try again."
  scene_context: "Steak on a white plate on the table; plate reachable; nothing is held; nearby grill and blue container present."
