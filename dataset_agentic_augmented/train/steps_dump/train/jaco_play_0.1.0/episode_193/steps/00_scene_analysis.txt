scene_analysis:
  target: "steak_meat"
  destination: "white_plate"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the steak meat from the table near the robot and place it into the white plate; if placing inside fails, retry up to 2 times and if it still fails use a push maneuver to reposition the steak as a fallback."
  scene_context: "Steak meat on table near robot gripper; white_plate on table and empty; no containers closed or blocking."
  expected_sequence: "Approach the steak, pick it up with the gripper, move to the white plate, attempt to set the steak into the plate (retry placement up to 2 times if it fails), and if placement still fails use a push to reposition the object and then place it."
