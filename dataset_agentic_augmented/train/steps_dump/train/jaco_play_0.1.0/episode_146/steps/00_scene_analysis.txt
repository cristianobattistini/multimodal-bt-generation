scene_analysis:
  target: "green_cup"
  destination: "dish_rack"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the green cup held by the robot and place it into the blue dish rack. If PLACE_INSIDE fails, retry up to 3 times within a 10s timeout; if still unsuccessful, use PUSH as an alternative to reposition the cup into the rack."
  scene_context: "Green cup is grasped by the robot above the bowl; blue dish_rack is open, empty, and reachable on the right."
  expected_sequence: "Move the held green cup over the dish rack and lower it into an empty slot until released. If PLACE_INSIDE fails, retry up to 3 times (within 10s); if unsuccessful, use a PUSH action to nudge the cup into the slot and confirm placement."
