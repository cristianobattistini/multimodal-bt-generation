  expanded_instruction: "Lift the green garbage can lid to open the trash can next to the table. Use the robustness strategy: group actions into the ApproachGreenGarbageCanLid subtree—approach the lid, attempt grasp with a 10s timeout, retry up to 3 times, and if grasp repeatedly fails, push to reposition and try again."
  scene_context: "Green trash can with lid closed beside a table; lid not held and robot arm nearby."
  expected_sequence: "Within the ApproachGreenGarbageCanLid subtree: move the arm to the lid, grasp its edge, and lift the lid until the can is open. If grasp fails, retry up to 3 times (10s timeout per attempt); if still failing, push to reposition the lid and retry."
