scene_analysis:
  target: "sponge"
  destination: "counter"
  expanded_instruction: "Check IS_REACHABLE on the top drawer before navigating; then pick up the yellow sponge from the open top drawer and place it on the counter (retry reachability check up to 3 times with a 10s timeout)."
  scene_context: "Top drawer is open with a yellow sponge inside; sponge is not held; counter is reachable and has a small cup but is not blocked."
  expected_sequence: "Check IS_REACHABLE on top_drawer; if reachable, navigate to the drawer, reach into the open drawer, grasp the sponge, lift it out, move to the counter, and set the sponge down—if grasp fails, attempt a reposition/push and retry up to 2 times."
