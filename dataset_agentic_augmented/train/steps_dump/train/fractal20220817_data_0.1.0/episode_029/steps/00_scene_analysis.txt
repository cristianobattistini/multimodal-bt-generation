scene_analysis:
  target: "redbull_can"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the redbull can from the table and place it upright on the table. Group the approach and pick actions into an ApproachRedbullCan subtree, and if the grasp fails retry up to 2 times."
  scene_context: "Redbull can is lying on its side on the table; table reachable and not blocked; robot not holding anything."
  expected_sequence: "Approach the can (as part of ApproachRedbullCan subtree), grasp it (retry up to 2 times if grasp fails), rotate it upright, and set it down on the table."
