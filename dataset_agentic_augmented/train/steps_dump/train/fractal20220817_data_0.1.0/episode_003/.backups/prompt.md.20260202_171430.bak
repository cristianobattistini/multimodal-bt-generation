ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Move coke can near water bottle. Retry placing on top up to 5 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj), GRASP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "coke_can"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Move coke can near water bottle. Retry placing on top up to 5 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "A coke can is located near the robot. A water bottle is on the table. The table is a valid placement surface."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the coke can, grasp it, navigate to the table near the water bottle, place the coke can on top of the table near the water bottle, then release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap PLACE_ON_TOP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="5").
