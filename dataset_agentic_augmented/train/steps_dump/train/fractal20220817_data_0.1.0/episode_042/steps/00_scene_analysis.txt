  scene_context: "Middle drawer is open; rxbar chocolate on tabletop near back; not held; drawer interior appears clear."
  expected_sequence: "Check IS_VISIBLE on the rxbar, reach to the rxbar, grasp it (grasp action within a 10s timeout, retry up to 2 times on failure), move over the open middle drawer, and place it inside."
