ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Picking a grape. Retry placing on top up to 4 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), RELEASE(), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "grape"
  destination: "plate"
  expanded_instruction: "Picking a grape. Retry placing on top up to 4 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "Grape is on the table within reach. Plate is on the table nearby to the right."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the grape, grasp it, navigate to the plate, place the grape on top of the plate (retrying up to 4 times if placement fails), then release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap PLACE_ON_TOP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="4").
