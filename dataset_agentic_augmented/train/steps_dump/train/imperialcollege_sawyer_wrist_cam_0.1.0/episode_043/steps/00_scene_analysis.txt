scene_analysis:
  target: "mug"
  destination: "mug"
  expanded_instruction: "Pour liquid into the blue mug sitting above the red object, grouping approach-and-pour steps into an ApproachPitcher subtree."
  scene_context: "Blue mug upright above a red object; mug initially empty and reachable; no visible lid."
  expected_sequence: "Use an ApproachPitcher subtree: bring a filled container over the mug and pour until it contains liquid; allow up to 3 retries, 10s timeout per step, and if grasp fails, push to reposition."
