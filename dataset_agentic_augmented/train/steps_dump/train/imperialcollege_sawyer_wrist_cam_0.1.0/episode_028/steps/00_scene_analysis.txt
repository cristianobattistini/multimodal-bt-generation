  expanded_instruction: "Check IS_GRASPABLE on each bowl before grasping; if not graspable, push to reposition and retry up to 3 times (10s timeout each). Then collect the loose bowls and stack them together into a single nested stack on the table."
  scene_context: "Multiple bowls on the table, some already partially nested; table surface clear enough for a stacked pile."
  expected_sequence: "For each bowl, check IS_GRASPABLE before GRASP; if not graspable, push to reposition and retry up to 3 times (10s timeout). Then gather each bowl and place them one inside another to form a single stack on the table."
