  expanded_instruction: "Group actions into ApproachWhitePlate subtree: Pick up the white plate from the table and place it on top of the red plate (ApproachWhitePlate subtree should attempt approach and grasp with a 10s timeout and retry up to 3 times; if grasp fails, push to reposition and retry)."
  scene_context: "Robot not holding anything; white_plate on table to the right of red_plate; red_plate on table and unobstructed."
  expected_sequence: "ApproachWhitePlate subtree: approach the white plate and lift it (10s timeout, retry up to 3 times; if grasp fails, push to reposition), move over the red plate, and lower the white plate onto the red plate."
