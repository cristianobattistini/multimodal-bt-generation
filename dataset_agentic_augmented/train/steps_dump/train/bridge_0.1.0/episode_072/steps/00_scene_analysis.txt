scene_analysis:
  target: "spoon"
  destination: "towel"
  expanded_instruction: "Group the approach steps into an 'ApproachSpoon' subtree: navigate to and approach the spoon on the left side of the counter (NAVIGATE_TO within a 20s timeout), pick up the spoon, and place it on the yellow towel. If navigation or approach fails, retry the approach subtree up to 2 more times."
  scene_context: "Yellow towel lies on the countertop; spoon with red handle is on the left counter surface; robot not holding anything."
  expected_sequence: "ApproachSpoon subtree: NAVIGATE_TO the spoon (within 20s timeout) and reach to the spoon, grasp it, move over the towel, and place the spoon on the towel; if approach or grasp fails, retry the ApproachSpoon subtree before aborting."
