ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Put knife on cutting board. Use a 15 second timeout for navigation.
- Allowed Actions: [PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), RELEASE(), GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "knife"
  destination: "cutting_board"
  expanded_instruction: "Put the knife on the cutting board. Use a 15 second timeout for navigation."
  scene_context: "Knife is reachable on the table within the workspace. Cutting board is clear and positioned on the countertop as the destination."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the knife, grasp the knife, navigate to the cutting board (with a 15 second timeout), place the knife on the cutting board, then release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness: Wrap NAVIGATE_TO with Timeout (msec="15000").
