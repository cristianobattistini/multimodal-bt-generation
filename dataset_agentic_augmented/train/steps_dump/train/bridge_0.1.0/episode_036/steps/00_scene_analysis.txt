scene_analysis:
  target: "pepper"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the green pepper and place it on the table to the right of the orange cloth; if direct placing (PLACE_ON_TOP) fails, retry up to 3 times within 10s and if still unsuccessful, use a PUSH maneuver to reposition the pepper to the right of the cloth."
  scene_context: "Green pepper on the left side of the table, orange cloth on table; nothing is held and table is clear otherwise."
  expected_sequence: "Pick up the pepper, move to the cloth, and set the pepper down on the table immediately to the right of the orange cloth; if PLACE_ON_TOP fails, retry up to 3 times (10s) and then use PUSH to reposition."
