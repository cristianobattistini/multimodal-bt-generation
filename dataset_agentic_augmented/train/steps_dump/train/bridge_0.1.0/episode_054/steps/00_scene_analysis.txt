scene_analysis:
  target: "red_fork"
  destination: "green_cloth"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the red fork from the countertop and place it onto the green cloth; before placing, check IS_HOLDING on the green cloth, retry the place action up to 2 times if it fails, and if placing still fails use a push to reposition the fork onto the cloth."
  scene_context: "Red fork lies on the table near a bowl; green cloth on the table is clear and reachable; no objects held."
  expected_sequence: "Approach the red fork, grasp it, carry it to the green cloth, check IS_HOLDING on the cloth before PLACE_ON_TOP, attempt PLACE_ON_TOP (retry up to 2 times on failure), and if placement fails use PUSH as an alternative to reposition the fork onto the cloth."
