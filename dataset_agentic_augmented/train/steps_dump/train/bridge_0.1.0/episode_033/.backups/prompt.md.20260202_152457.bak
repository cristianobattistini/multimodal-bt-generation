ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Move cucumber to the upper left of counter. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), RELEASE(), GRASP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "cucumber"
  destination: "upper_left_of_counter"
  expanded_instruction: "Move the cucumber to the upper-left area of the counter. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "The cucumber is located on the counter within reachable distance. The workspace contains a counter with a clear upper-left area as the intended placement location. No obstacles between robot and cucumber are apparent in the current view."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the cucumber, attempt grasping (retrying up to 3 times if needed), navigate to the upper-left of the counter, place the cucumber on the counter, and release."
