scene_analysis:
  target: "mushroom"
  destination: "pot"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the mushroom from the stovetop and place it into the pot on the stove; when grasping, allow a 15s timeout and retry up to 3 times, and if grasp fails, try pushing or flipping the mushroom to reposition it."
  scene_context: "Mushroom on the left burner of the stove; pot is on the right burner and open; mushroom not held."
  expected_sequence: "Reach the mushroom, grasp and lift it (grasp may time out after 15s and be retried up to 3 times; if grasp fails, use push or flip to reposition), move it over the pot, and place it inside."
