scene_analysis:
  target: "cup"
  destination: "stovetop"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the red cup from the green plate and place it on the stovetop next to the plate. If placing on top fails, retry up to 3 times (within a 10s timeout) and if still unsuccessful, use a push to reposition the cup."
  scene_context: "Red cup sitting on green plate on the stovetop; cup not held; stovetop surface clear enough to place cup."
  expected_sequence: "Reach to the cup, lift it off the plate, and set it down on the stovetop next to the plate; if place-on-top fails after retries, push to reposition the cup."
