ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Take the silver vessel and place it on the purple cloth. If placing on top fails, push the destination cloth area to clear obstacles or reposition the cloth and then retry placing.
- Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PUSH(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness: If placing on top fails due to destination clutter or misalignment, the planner will use PUSH to clear or reposition the cloth area and then retry the placing action to improve robustness.
