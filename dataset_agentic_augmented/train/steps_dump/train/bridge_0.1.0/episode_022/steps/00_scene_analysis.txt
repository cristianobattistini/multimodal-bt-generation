scene_analysis:
  target: "silver_vessel"
  destination: "purple_cloth"

  scene_context: "Silver vessel on table left of a clear purple cloth; vessel not held; cloth unobstructed."
  expected_sequence: "Approach and grasp the silver vessel, lift it, move over the purple cloth, and place the vessel down on the cloth; if PLACE_ON_TOP fails, retry placement up to 2 times (10s), then use PUSH as an alternative to reposition the object onto the cloth."
