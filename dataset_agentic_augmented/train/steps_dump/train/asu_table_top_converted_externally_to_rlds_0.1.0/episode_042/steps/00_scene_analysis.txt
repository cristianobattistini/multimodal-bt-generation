scene_analysis:
  target: "red_object"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Check that the red object (tall red block) is visible (IS_VISIBLE); if not, reposition and retry up to 3 times within a 10s timeout. Then pick it up from the table and hold it."
  scene_context: "Red object on table front-center, not held; table clear; no containers open or closed."
  expected_sequence: "Verify IS_VISIBLE on the red object before attempting a grasp (reposition/retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout); then approach the red object, grasp it securely, lift it, and hold it above the table. If grasp fails, push to reposition and retry."
