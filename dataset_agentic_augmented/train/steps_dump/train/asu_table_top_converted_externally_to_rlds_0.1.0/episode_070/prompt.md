Instruction: hold blue bottle. If grasping fails, push the blue bottle to reposition it and retry grasping.
Allowed Actions: [PUSH(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj)]
* Constraints: Robustness: If grasping fails, the behavior must use PUSH to reposition the object (e.g., make it closer/upright/less occluded) and then retry grasping as the fallback strategy.
