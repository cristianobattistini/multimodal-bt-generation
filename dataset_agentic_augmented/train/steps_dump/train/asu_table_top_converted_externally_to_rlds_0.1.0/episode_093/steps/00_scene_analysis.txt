  scene_context: "Coke can (red) on the tabletop near center-front, not held; table is clear and robot arm is free."
  expected_sequence: "Use the ApproachCokeCan subtree to move the arm to the can (10s timeout, retry up to 3 times), grasp the coke can firmly, and lift it clear of the table; if grasp fails, attempt a push-to-reposition then retry."
