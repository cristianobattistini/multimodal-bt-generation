scene_analysis:
  target: "grid_clamp"
  destination: "grid_plate"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the grid_clamp from the tabletop and place it into the grid_plate on the left side of the table, with each grasp completed within a 15 second timeout and retrying the grasp up to 2 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "Grid_clamp on front of table; grid_plate (tray with grid holes) on left is reachable and appears empty."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the clamp, pick it up (grasp must finish within 15s; retry up to 2 times on failure), carry it to the grid_plate at the left, and set it into the grid holes."
