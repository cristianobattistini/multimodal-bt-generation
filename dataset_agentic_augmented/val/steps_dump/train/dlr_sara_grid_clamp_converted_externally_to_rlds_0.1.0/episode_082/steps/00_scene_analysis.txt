  target: "grid_clamp"
  destination: "grid_board"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the grid_clamp from the pile on the table, attempting the grasp within a 10s timeout and retrying up to 3 times if it fails (reposition between attempts), then place it onto the grid_board grooves on the wooden panel"
  scene_context: "Pile of grid_clamps on table; wooden grid_board is exposed and unobstructed; nothing held."
  expected_sequence: "Reach the pile, pick a grid_clamp (grasp within 10s, retry up to 3 times if it fails and reposition between tries), move over the grid_board, and set the clamp onto the grooves."
