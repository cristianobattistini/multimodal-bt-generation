scene_analysis:
  target: "peg"
  destination: "hole"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the peg from the small base and insert it into the triangular hole on the base. If grasp fails, retry up to 3 times and, if still unsuccessful, push or flip the peg to reposition it before attempting insertion."
  scene_context: "Peg rests on a small base on the table; hole is open and accessible; robot not holding the peg."
  expected_sequence: "Reach to the peg, grasp it (retry up to 3 times); if grasp fails, push or flip the peg to reposition it, then align it with the triangular hole and insert it fully into the hole within a 10s timeout."
