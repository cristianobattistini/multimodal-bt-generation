ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Pick up the green object from the table. If grasping fails, push the green object to reposition it and retry grasping.
- Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), PUSH(obj), GRASP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "green_object"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the green object from the table. If grasping fails, push the green object to reposition it and retry grasping."
  scene_context: "The green object is on the table within the workspace. It may be awkwardly oriented or partially occluded, so an initial grasp attempt could fail."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the green object, attempt grasping; if grasping fails, push the object to improve pose, then attempt grasping again."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness strategy: If the primary grasp attempt fails due to object pose, occlusion, or distance, the plan explicitly repositions the object via a push action before retrying grasping to increase chance of success.
