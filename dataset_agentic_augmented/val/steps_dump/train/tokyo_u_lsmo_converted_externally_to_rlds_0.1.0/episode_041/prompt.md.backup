ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: avoid obstacle and reach the blue pen. Retry grasping up to 4 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "blue_pen"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Avoid obstacle and reach the blue pen. Retry grasping up to 4 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "There's an obstacle between the robot and the blue pen; a stack_of_books and a pen_holder are present near the target."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate around the obstacle by approaching the stack of books, move to the pen holder, then grasp the blue pen (retry grasping up to 4 times if needed)."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap GRASP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="4").
