ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Avoid obstacle and reach the scissors. If grasping fails, push the scissors to reposition it and retry grasping.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), PUSH(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "scissors"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Avoid obstacle and reach the scissors. If grasping fails, push the scissors to reposition it and retry grasping."
  scene_context: "A table with scissors near a dark brown pen holder that partially occludes one side. The path requires approaching from the clear side to avoid collision."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the table, navigate to the scissors while avoiding the pen holder, attempt grasping the scissors; if grasping fails, push the scissors to reorient it and try grasping again, then release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness strategy: The plan must include a fallback that actively repositions the target (push) to address failure causes (awkward pose, occlusion, or distance) before retrying the primary grasping action.
