  target: "scissors"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Move the robot arm around the book stack and brown pen_holder to reach and pick up the scissors on the table, attempting the grasp within a 10s timeout, retrying up to 2 times and, if grasp fails, using push or flip to reposition the scissors."
  scene_context: "Scissors on table near back-left; book stack and brown pen_holder between arm base and scissors; arm not holding anything."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate the arm trajectory around the book stack and pen_holder, extend to grasp the scissors (each grasp within a 10s timeout, retry up to 2 times), and lift them; if grasp repeatedly fails, push or flip to reposition and then grasp."
