scene_analysis:
  target: "pot"
  destination: "sink"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the pot from the countertop and place it into the sink. Before grasping, check the pot is graspable; perform the GRASP with a 10s timeout and retry up to 2 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "Pot on countertop beside stove; sink is empty and reachable; pot is not held."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the pot, check IS_GRASPABLE, grasp it (GRASP attempts have a 10s timeout and may be retried up to 2 times), lift and move it over the sink, then set it down inside."
