Instruction: Place the pot in the sink. If grasping fails, push the pot to reposition it and retry grasping.
Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_INSIDE(obj), PUSH(obj)]
* Constraints: Robustness: The plan should include a fallback strategy that addresses likely physical causes of failure (e.g., re-positioning the object) before retrying the primary action.
