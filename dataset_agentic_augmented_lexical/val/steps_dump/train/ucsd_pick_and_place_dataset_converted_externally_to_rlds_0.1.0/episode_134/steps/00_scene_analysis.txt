scene_analysis:
  target: "pot"
  destination: "sink"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the pot from the countertop next to the stove and place it into the sink. Group actions into an ApproachPot subtree; attempt approach and grasp, retry up to 3 times or within a 10s timeout, and if grasp fails, push to reposition before retrying."
  scene_context: "Pot on countertop beside stove; sink is empty and uncovered; robot arm not holding the pot."
  expected_sequence: "Use the ApproachPot subtree: approach the pot, grasp and lift it (retry up to 3 times or within a 10s timeout; if grasp fails, push to reposition), move over the sink, and set the pot down inside."
