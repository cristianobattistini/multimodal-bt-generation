  scene_context: "Several grid_clamps resting on the table; none held; grid surface is clear and reachable."
  expected_sequence: "Approach a grid_clamp, pick it up, move to the grid area, and place it on the grid; if grasp fails retry up to 3 times, then use push or flip to reposition the object and complete the placement."
