ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Pour into the mug. If flipping the brown pitcher fails, push the brown pitcher to reposition it and retry flipping.
- Allowed Actions: [POUR(obj), FLIP(obj), PUSH(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness: Provide a fallback strategy that uses an alternative action to address common physical failure causes (e.g., poor pose or occlusion). The fallback should reposition the object (using push) and then retry flipping to increase success likelihood.
