  scene_context: "Pink towel crumpled on green mat on table, not held, table surface otherwise clear."
  expected_sequence: "Verify towel IS_VISIBLE on table, retry up to 3 times if needed, then NAVIGATE_TO table, reach the towel, grasp and lift parts, spread and smooth it flat on the table (if grasp fails, reposition and retry)."
