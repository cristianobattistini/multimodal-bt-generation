scene_analysis:
  target: "canned_spam"
  destination: "sink"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the canned_spam from the counter and place it into the sink, retrying the place action up to 3 times if it fails; if placing still fails, use a push to reposition the can into the sink."
  scene_context: "Canned_spam on the counter next to the sink; sink is open and clear; robot not holding anything."
  expected_sequence: "Approach the can, pick up the canned_spam, move over the sink, attempt PLACE_INSIDE and retry up to 3 times if needed; if PLACE_INSIDE fails, use PUSH as a fallback to reposition the object into the sink."
