ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Put the bowl inside the kitchen cabinet. Use a 15 second timeout for navigation.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), RELEASE(), PLACE_INSIDE(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "bowl"
  destination: "kitchen_cabinet"
  expanded_instruction: "Put the bowl inside the kitchen cabinet. Use a 15 second timeout for navigation."
  scene_context: "The bowl is on the counter near the kitchen area. The kitchen cabinet is closed and located to the robot's right. No obstacles are immediately blocking the path."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the bowl (with a 15 second timeout), grasp the bowl, navigate to the kitchen cabinet, place the bowl inside the cabinet, and release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap NAVIGATE_TO with Timeout (msec="15000").
