ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Pick the orange. Retry grasping up to 2 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "orange"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Pick the orange. Retry grasping up to 2 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "A robot workspace with a chair near an orange on a table. The orange is reachable after navigating around the chair."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the chair to reposition, navigate to the orange, then grasp the orange (retrying the grasp up to 2 times if needed)."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness: Wrap GRASP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="2").
