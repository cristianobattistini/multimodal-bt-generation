  expanded_instruction: "Group actions into an ApproachYellowPlate subtree: approach and pick up the yellow plate (retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout, if grasp fails, push to reposition), then pick up the white cup and place both into the dish_rack."
  scene_context: "Dish_rack is empty and reachable; yellow_plate on table left of rack; white_cup on towel to the right; towel on tray."
  expected_sequence: "Group into ApproachYellowPlate subtree: approach and pick up the yellow plate one at a time (retry up to 3 times, 10s timeout, if grasp fails, push to reposition), then pick up the white cup and place them into the dish_rack."
