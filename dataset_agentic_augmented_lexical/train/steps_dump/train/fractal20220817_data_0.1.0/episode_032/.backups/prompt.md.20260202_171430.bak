ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Move green rice chip bag near orange. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails.
- Allowed Actions: [PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "green_rice_chip_bag"
  destination: "near_orange"
  expanded_instruction: "Move green rice chip bag near orange. Retry grasping up to 3 times if it fails."
  scene_context: "The green rice chip bag is on the table. An orange is located on the table; the goal is to bring the bag close to the orange."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the green rice chip bag, grasp it (retrying up to 3 times if necessary), navigate to the table near the orange, place the bag on the table near the orange, and release."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap GRASP with RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="3").
