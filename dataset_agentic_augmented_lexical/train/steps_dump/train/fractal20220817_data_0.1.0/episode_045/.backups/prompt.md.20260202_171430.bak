ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: move redbull can near 7up can. Check that the robot is holding the object before placing it on top; retry placing on top up to 2 times if it fails, and use pushing as a plan B if unsuccessful.
- Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), PUSH(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj)]
- Allowed Actions: [NAVIGATE_TO(obj), PUSH(obj), GRASP(obj), PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PLACE_NEXT_TO(obj)]
- Allowed Conditions: [IS_HOLDING]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions and Allowed Conditions provided.
5. Robustness: Verify precondition, RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="2") for PLACE_ON_TOP, use alternative strategy if all attempts fail.

CONSTRAINT: Robustness: Verify precondition, RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts="2") for PLACE_ON_TOP, use alternative strategy if all attempts fail.
