scene_analysis:
  target: "tiger"
  destination: "grey_bowl"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick the tiger toy out of the red bowl and place it into the grey bowl. If placing inside fails, retry up to 3 times (within a 10s timeout) and, if it still fails, use a pushing motion to reposition the toy into the grey bowl as a fallback."
  scene_context: "Tiger toy inside red_bowl on table; grey_bowl is empty and nearby; robot arm not holding anything."
  expected_sequence: "Reach into the red_bowl, grasp the tiger, lift it out, move to the grey_bowl, and place it inside; if PLACE_INSIDE fails, retry up to 3 times (10s total) and then use PUSH as an alternative to reposition the object into the grey_bowl."
