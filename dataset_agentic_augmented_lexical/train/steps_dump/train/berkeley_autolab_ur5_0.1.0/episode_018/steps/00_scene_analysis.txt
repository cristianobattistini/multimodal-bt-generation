  scene_context: "Green cloth on tabletop near robot arm; cloth not held; table surface otherwise clear."
  expected_sequence: "Verify green_cloth is visible before acting (retry up to 3 times within 10s); approach the cloth, and if grasp fails push to reposition, then sweep it leftward across the table until it reaches the left side."
