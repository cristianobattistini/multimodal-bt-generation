  target: "mug"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the white mug from the blue surface; first check IS_GRASPABLE on the mug before attempting to grasp, and if not graspable try repositioning (nudge) and retry up to 3 times with a 10s timeout per attempt."
  scene_context: "White mug resting on a clear blue surface; mug not held; no containers open or obstacles."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the mug, check IS_GRASPABLE, then grasp the mug (handle or body) and lift it off the surface; if a grasp fails, push/nudge to reposition and retry up to 3 times (10s timeout each)."
