ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Pick up apple. Use a 20 second timeout for navigation.
- Allowed Actions: [GRASP(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "apple"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the apple from the scene. Use a 20 second timeout for navigation."
  scene_context: "The apple is visible on a nearby table within the robot's workspace. No obstacles immediately occluding the apple are observed. The robot can reach the apple after approaching the table."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the apple (with a 20 second timeout), then grasp the apple."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
Robustness: Wrap NAVIGATE_TO with Timeout (msec="20000").
