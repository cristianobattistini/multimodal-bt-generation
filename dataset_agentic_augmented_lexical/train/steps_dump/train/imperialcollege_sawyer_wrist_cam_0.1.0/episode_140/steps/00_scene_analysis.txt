scene_analysis:
  target: "toast_slice"
  destination: "toaster_slot"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the toast slice and insert it into an open slot of the red toaster; if the insert (PLACE_INSIDE) fails, retry the PLACE_INSIDE action up to 3 times."
  scene_context: "Red toaster sits upright on a clear blue surface; slots are open and the toast slice is nearby and not held."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the toast slice, pick it up, align it with a toaster slot, and insert it fully into the slot; if inserting fails, retry the PLACE_INSIDE action up to 3 times until successful."
