scene_analysis:
  target: "red_towel"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Check that the red towel on the countertop is reachable, then pick it up (grasp with a 15s timeout and retry up to 2 times if needed) and place it just left of the yellow knife on the table."
  scene_context: "Red towel on countertop/back-left; yellow knife on table near the pan; countertop/table is clear and no containers are closed."
  expected_sequence: "Verify IS_REACHABLE for the red towel, approach and pick up the red towel (grasp with a 15s timeout, retry up to 2 times on failure), move to the area just left of the yellow knife on the table, and place the towel there."
