  scene_context: "Mushroom on wooden table near stove; blue cloth folded on table and clear; gripper not holding anything; no containers open."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the mushroom, grasp and lift it, carry it to the blue cloth, and set it down on top. If PLACE_ON_TOP fails after up to 3 retries, use PUSH as an alternative to reposition the object onto the cloth."
