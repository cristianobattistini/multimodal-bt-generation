scene_analysis:
  target: "napkin"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the blue napkin from the table and place it in the bottom right corner of the table. If placing on top fails, retry up to 3 times (within a 10s timeout) and, if still unsuccessful, use a push action to reposition the napkin into the target corner."
  scene_context: "Blue napkin on the table near the right side; robot not holding it; table surface clear."
  expected_sequence: "Reach to the napkin, grasp it, move to the table's bottom-right corner, and set it down there. If place-on-top fails after retries, perform a push to reposition the napkin into the bottom-right corner."
