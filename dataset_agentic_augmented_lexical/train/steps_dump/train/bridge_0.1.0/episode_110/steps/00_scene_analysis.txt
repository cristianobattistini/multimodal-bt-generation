  target: "eggplant"
  destination: "yellow_cloth"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the eggplant and place it on top of the yellow cloth on the table. Before placing, check IS_HOLDING on the yellow_cloth; if placing fails, retry the PLACE_ON_TOP action up to 3 times."
  scene_context: "Eggplant sits near the left side of the table by a folded yellow_cloth; cloth is on the table and clear; nothing is held."
  expected_sequence: "Reach the eggplant, grasp it, move over the yellow_cloth, check IS_HOLDING on yellow_cloth before PLACE_ON_TOP, and place the eggplant on top of the cloth (retry PLACE_ON_TOP up to 3 times if it fails)."
