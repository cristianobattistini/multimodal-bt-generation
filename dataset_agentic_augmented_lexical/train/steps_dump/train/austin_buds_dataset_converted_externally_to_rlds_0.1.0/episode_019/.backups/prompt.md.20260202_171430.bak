ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Take the lid off the pot, put the pot on the plate, and use the tool to push to pot to the front of the table. If grasping the lid fails, push the lid to reposition it and then retry grasping.
- Allowed Actions: [PLACE_ON_TOP(obj), PUSH(obj), OPEN(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), RELEASE(), GRASP(obj)]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "<main object to manipulate, snake_case>"
  destination: "<where to place object, snake_case or empty>"
  expanded_instruction: "<instruction with scene details>"
  scene_context: "<initial state observations>"
  expected_sequence: "<action plan in natural language>"
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided.
5. Robustness strategy: If the primary grasping action on the lid fails, the plan uses a fallback that pushes the lid to improve its pose for grasping and then retries grasping; this fallback uses only allowed actions and preserves the rest of the plan.
