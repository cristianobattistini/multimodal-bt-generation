  scene_context: "Blue bottle sitting on the table among other objects; table is clear and no containers are closed."
  expected_sequence: "Verify blue_bottle IS_VISIBLE (retry up to 3 times/10s), approach the blue bottle, grasp it, lift slightly, then set it down on the table; if grasp fails, push to reposition and retry."
