scene_analysis:
  target: "red_bottle"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Place the red bottle down onto the table using the ApproachRedBottle subtree; retry up to 3 times with a 10s timeout."
  scene_context: "Red bottle is already upright on the table and not held; table surface is clear."
  expected_sequence: "Approach the red bottle (via ApproachRedBottle subtree), grasp it if held or pick it up — if grasp fails, push to reposition and retry up to 3 times within a 10s timeout, then set it down on the table."
