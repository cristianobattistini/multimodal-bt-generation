scene_analysis:
  target: "milk_carton"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Check that the red milk carton on the right side of the table is reachable (check IS_REACHABLE) before attempting to push it; if not reachable, retry the reachability check up to 3 times within a 10s timeout, then push it forward across the table."
  scene_context: "Milk carton upright on right side of table; table surface clear; robot not holding anything."
  expected_sequence: "Check IS_REACHABLE on the milk_carton before PUSH; if reachable, move the arm to the milk carton, make contact with its side, and push it forward across the table. If IS_REACHABLE initially fails, retry up to 3 times (10s timeout) before aborting."
