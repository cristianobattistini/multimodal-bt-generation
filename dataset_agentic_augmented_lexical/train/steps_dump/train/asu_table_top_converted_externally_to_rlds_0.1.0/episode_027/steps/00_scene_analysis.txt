scene_analysis:
  target: "red_object"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the red object from the table and place it near the front edge of the table; if placing on top fails, retry up to 3 times (within ~10s), and if still failing use a push action to reposition the object near the front edge."
  scene_context: "Table is clear; red object on table amid other items; no containers; object not held."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the red object, grasp it, carry it to the front edge of the table, and set it down; if PLACE_ON_TOP fails, retry (up to 3 attempts, ~10s) and otherwise use PUSH as an alternative to reposition the object near the front edge."
