scene_analysis:
  target: "glass_bottle"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the glass bottle from the table and put it down on the table surface; if placing on top fails, retry up to 3 times (within 10s), then use a PUSH to reposition the object as a fallback."
  scene_context: "Glass bottle upright on the table near the right side; robot not holding it; table surface reachable and mostly clear."
  expected_sequence: "Move to the bottle, grasp it, lift slightly, then place it down on the table surface; if PLACE_ON_TOP fails, retry up to 2 times, then use PUSH to reposition the object and complete the placement."
