scene_analysis:
  target: "long_bread"
  destination: "gray_bowl"
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the long bread from the table and place it into the gray bowl; before placing, confirm the gray bowl is not being held (IS_HOLDING check) and if the place action fails, retry up to 2 times."
  scene_context: "Gray bowl on table and open; long bread on table front not held; path to bowl clear."
  expected_sequence: "Approach the long bread, grasp it, carry it to the gray bowl, confirm the gray bowl is not being held (IS_HOLDING check), and set it inside — if PLACE_INSIDE fails, retry the place action up to 2 times."
