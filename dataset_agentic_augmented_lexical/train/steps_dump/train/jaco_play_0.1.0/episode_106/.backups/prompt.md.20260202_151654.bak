ROLE: Embodied Planner
GOAL: Analyze the scene and generate a valid BehaviorTree.CPP XML plan.

INPUTS:
- Scene Image: The current visual observation of the robot workspace
- Instruction: Pick up the apple fruit. If grasping fails, push the apple closer and retry.
- Allowed Actions: [PUSH(obj), NAVIGATE_TO(obj), GRASP(obj), RELEASE()]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
scene_analysis:
  target: "apple_fruit"
  destination: ""
  expanded_instruction: "Pick up the apple fruit. If grasping fails, push the apple closer and retry."
  scene_context: "The apple is on the table within reach but may be slightly far, partially occluded, or awkwardly oriented for direct grasping."
  expected_sequence: "Navigate to the apple, attempt grasping. If grasping fails, push the apple to reposition it and then attempt grasping again, finally release if needed."
Plan:
<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
  ...
</root>

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Analysis First: You MUST output the scene_analysis block before the XML.
2. Consistency: The XML must follow the analysis (target/destination).
3. Schema: Output ONLY the keys shown above; do NOT add extra keys.
4. Compliance: Use ONLY the Allowed Actions provided. The plan adds PUSH(obj) to the allowed actions to enable the fallback strategy.
