scene_analysis:
  target: "pink_cloth"
  destination: "table"
  expanded_instruction: "Perform the ApproachTable subtree to move to the table (use NAVIGATE_TO with a 15s timeout), then pick up the pink cloth on the table and fold it inward so it becomes a smaller, neatly aligned rectangle on the table."
  scene_context: "Pink cloth flat on a clear wooden table; no container; robot not holding the cloth."
  expected_sequence: "Use the ApproachTable subtree (NAVIGATE_TO within 15s timeout) to reach the table, then reach to a corner, lift and fold the corner toward the cloth center, press the fold flat, and release it on the table."
